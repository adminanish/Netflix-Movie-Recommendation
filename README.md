# Netflix-Movie-Recommendation
## Project Overview
I am currently learning to predict user ratings on Netflix movies using data from the Netflix Prize dataset. This project focuses on developing a recommendation system that can predict how a user will rate a given movie.

In this repo, I will be updating my learnings and progress gradually as I advance through different stages of the project.
